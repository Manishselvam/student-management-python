# Student Management System - Python (Day 2 Project)

## Overview
This is a simple **Student Management System** built in Python.  
It allows users to **add, view, search, and delete students**.  
All student data is saved to a file, so it **persists between program runs**.  

This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates **Python programming** and **file handling**.
## Features
- Add a student (Name + Roll Number)  
- View all students  
- Search for a student by Roll Number  
- Delete a student by Roll Number  
- Persistent storage using `students.json` file  
## How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.  
2. Clone the repository or download the project.  
3. Open terminal in the project folder.  
4. Run the program:

## Files
- `student_management.py` → Main Python program  
- `students.json` → Stores student data (created automatically)  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python basics: variables, loops, functions  
- File handling: read/write JSON  
- Command-line interface (CLI)  
- Git & GitHub version control  
## Next Steps
- Enhance project with **GUI**  
- Add **sorting or search optimization**
